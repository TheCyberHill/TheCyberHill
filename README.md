# 👋 Hi there, I'm Aaron Hill

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Specialist | Active Learner | Home Lab Enthusiast

I’m a cybersecurity specialist with a B.S. in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance (WGU, 2025) and a stack of industry certifications—CompTIA Security+, CySA+, Pentest+, Network+, SSCP, and more. I thrive in active security environments, whether I’m threat hunting across packet streams or probing web apps for vulnerabilities.

I bring real-world IT operations experience from managing 200+ websites, plus hands-on technical labs centered around network defense, offensive testing, and automation. I believe cybersecurity isn't just about reacting—it's about proactively understanding systems and anticipating threats before they happen.

## 🎯 Career Focus
I’m open to SOC analyst, security engineer, or penetration testing opportunities. My long-term goal is to work in **active defense or offense**—hunting threats, analyzing exploits, and building stronger systems.

## 🧪 Projects & Labs

- **🐉 Kali Linux VM Lab Environment**: Created a dedicated virtual machine for ethical hacking and offensive labs. Includes automation scripts and custom configurations for safe vulnerability testing.
- **🔍 Web Security Labs**: Completed hands-on challenges targeting SQL injection, XSS, and IDOR vulnerabilities. Used Burp Suite to attack and remediate issues.
- 🚧 Active development in progress: Additional projects and walkthroughs will be posted regularly as my skill set expands.
